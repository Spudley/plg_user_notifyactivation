Notify Activation
-----------------
This is a plugin for Joomla that triggers the system to create a user note when an account is activated.

The generated user note will allow site administrators to see at a glance when and how a user account was activated.

This can be useful for reference and for resolving disputes and queries about account activation.

Version History
----------------
* 1.0.0     2016-07-03: Initial release.
* 1.0.1     2016-07-14: Bug fixes: Now works in all three scenarios.


Installation
----------------
This is a standard Joomla plugin. Installation is via Joomla's extension manager.

Usage
----------------
The plugin has one parameter:

* User note category - This parameter allows you to specify which user notes category the generated notes should be created in. Leave blank for the default 'Uncategorised'.

Motivation
----------------
This plugin was written from scratch after attempting to resolve a user query over account activation. The account had been activated but the user claimed not to have done so himself and none of the site admins had done it either. We were unable to answer the question. Having the functionality in this plugin would have helped to resolve this.

License
----------------
As with all Joomla extensions, this plugin is licensed under the GPLv2. The full license document should have been included with the source code.
